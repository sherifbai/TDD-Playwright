# Bürokratt Playwright Test Suite

This repository contains the current Playwright-based automated test suite for the **Bürokratt admin interface, chat widget, and selected API-facing flows**.

Playwright is an end-to-end browser automation framework; in this project it is used to validate UI behavior, smoke coverage, and selected API-facing flows in test and stage environments.

The project is structured around a practical mix of:

- **smoke coverage** for key pages and navigation paths
- **UI validation tests** for the admin-side service builder
- **API smoke checks** for major admin, analytics, and chat views
- **limited end-to-end flows** for real user journeys
- **Page Object Model (POM)** abstractions for reuse and maintainability
- **local, Docker, and GitHub Actions execution**

---

## Quick Start

Use this repository in three ways:

- Local and Docker test execution: [Running tests guide](docs/running_tests.md)
- CI setup and configuration: [CI setup guide](docs/ci_setup.md)
- Current coverage and scope: [Coverage summary](docs/coverage.md)

CI trigger model:

- label-triggered runs via issue label `run-at-tests`
- manual runs via workflow dispatch
- scheduled all-tests run on weekdays at `03:30 UTC` (`06:30` Tallinn during EEST)
- issue runs are marked with `testing...` while execution is in progress

---

## Current project state

At the moment the repository includes:

- coverage split across **smoke**, **UI visibility/functionality**, **API smoke**, and **E2E flow** suites, with limited widget-related coverage through broader flows
- a strong current focus on the **Services** area in the admin application
- environment targeting for both **test** and **stage** deployments
- reusable page objects for admin navigation, chats, services, training, and widget interactions
- two active CI workflows:
  - issue/manual execution: `project-v2-acceptance-testing.yml`
  - weekday scheduled full run: `scheduled-all-tests.yml`

For current counts and detailed suite breakdown, see [`docs/coverage.md`](docs/coverage.md).

## Configuration

### Environment selection

The Playwright UI configuration supports two environments:

- `test`
- `stage`

The default environment is resolved from `ENV`, with a fallback to `test` inside the config.

Base URLs are defined centrally in `playwright.config.js`.

### Projects in `playwright.config.js`

The repository currently defines these Playwright projects:

- `mock`
- `auth`
- `setup`
- `smoke`
- `flow`
- `tests`

The API suite also has a separate Playwright configuration in `playwright.config.api.js`.

## Implementation

Implementation guidance for new tests:

- [Testing strategy](docs/testing_strategy.md) for scope and workflow
- [Running tests guide](docs/running_tests.md) for execution patterns

How implementation is done in this repository:

- Tests primarily follow the **Page Object Model**
- Shared setup logic lives under `tests/.setup/`
- Admin authentication state is stored under `tests/admin/.auth/`
- Translation-related setup exists under `tests/admin/.translation/`
- Console errors are monitored in shared setup helpers
- Main UI suite runs with **4 workers in CI** and **50% of available workers locally** by default
- API Playwright config runs with **single-worker execution in CI**

Shared test infrastructure includes:

- environment URL resolution in `utils/env/urls.js`
- route-aware page readiness waits in `utils/waits/admin-page-ready.js`
- deterministic service test data in `utils/test-data/service-data.js`
- paginated admin table helpers in `page-objects/common/paginated-data-table.js`
- service-specific helper utilities in `tests/admin/services/service-test-helpers.js`

---

## Current limitations

- There is **no automated line/branch code coverage instrumentation** in the repository yet
- Coverage today is best understood as **functional test coverage by feature area**
- Some areas have only smoke-level coverage
- The service creation E2E flow is present but currently **skipped**
- Training functionality coverage is still relatively light compared to Services
